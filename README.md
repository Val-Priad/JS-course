## Projects

### 1. Guess My Number

A simple game where you try to guess a **randomly generated** number.

### 2. Pig Game

#### Objective

Be the first player to reach **20 points**.

#### Setup

- 2 players
- One 6-sided die

#### How to Play

1. Players take turns rolling the die.
2. On your turn, you can roll **as many times as you like**, adding up the total of your rolls.
3. However, if you roll a **1**, your turn ends and you **lose all points** earned during that turn.
4. You can choose to **"hold"** at any time, which means:
   - You keep the points you've earned that turn.
   - Those points are added to your **total score**, and your turn ends.
5. The first player to reach **20 points or more** wins the game.

#### Example

- Player A rolls: 5 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí holds ‚Üí **earns** 14 points.
- Player B rolls: 2 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí **loses** all points that turn.

## üß† What I Learned

I've learned a lot and can confidently say I now have a solid foundation in modern JavaScript development. Here's what I've covered:

- Gained a deep understanding of how JavaScript works under the hood
- Got comfortable with modern **ES6+ features** like arrow functions, destructuring, the spread operator, optional chaining, and more
- Studied object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes, constructors, inheritance, and encapsulation
- Tackled advanced topics like `this`, higher-order functions, and closures
- Worked with asynchronous JavaScript‚Äîevent loop, promises, async/await, and API interactions
- Used modern development tools like **NPM, Parcel, Babel**, and **ES6 modules**
